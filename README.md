# giveaway-grabber ðŸ’°

This script will loop through all your Amazon giveaways and try to submit entries for them. 

**WIP** - "no entry requirement" giveaways are implemented for first page. Need to include page iteration next.

Wanted a reason to experiment with puppeteer, so here goes.

## Installing/Getting started

Copy .env.example to .env, adding your own Amazon username and password.

```javascript
$ NPM install
$ NPM start
```

Check the console to see how things are going.
